In this challenge, we focus on exploring the potential of supervised models in identifying dark matter based on simulated strong lensing images with different substructure.\n","\n","This is an example notebook for the Multi-Class Classification Challenge. In this notebook, we demonstrate a simple CNN model implemented using the PyTorch library to solve the task of multi-class classification of strong lensing images.\n","\n","### Dataset\n","\n","The Dataset consists of three classes, strong lensing images with no substructure, spherical substructure, and vortex substructure. The images have been normalized using min-max normalization, but you are free to use any normalization or data augmentation methods to improve your results.\n","\n","Link to the Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_UZtU4W65ZViTJsLeFfvK-xXCYUhw2A/view?usp=sharing\n","\n","### Evaluation Metrics\n","\n","* ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AUC score (Area Under the ROC Curve)   \n","\n","The model performance will be tested on the hidden test dataset based on the above metrics.\n","\n","### Instructions for using the notebook\n","\n","1.
